Why Python?
-----------
>less development time b'coz of huge library
>it is best known for it's easy syntax and readability
>now a days trending because of it's vast usage in machine 
learning  application.

Why not python?
---------------
>poor performence
>not a first choice in mobile app dev

What is Python:
---------------
>it is a general purpose,high level,intrepreted,open source PL.
>supports multi paradigms
>dynamically typed
>platform independent
>portable
>first appeared in 1991,by guido van rossum
>current version is 3.9

General Purpose:
----------------
>you may create any type of s/w
	>desktop
	>web app
	>iot app
	>ai app
	etc.

High Level:
-----------
High level->Human readable(english like abcd,12,3,+-,..)
low level->cpu readable(0101010)

Interpreter->

>this tool is responsible to generate low level code from high level code.

Open source:
------------
>you may obtain python distribution from official website of python free of cost.

>you will also get source code of python standard library.

Paradigm:
---------
>way of writting inst. in program
	>imperative
	>procedural
	>object oriented
	>functional(lambda expression)

python supports all above paradigms.

Platform Independent:
--------------------
	>bydefault it is not executed under os directly
	>you need Python environment(Interpreter) to run python programs.

Portable:
---------
	>This python environment is available to all most OS so that we run
program on diff os.


Static v/s Dynamic type Language:
---------------------------------
>statically typed
>dynamically typed

>in ST,programmer is responsible to specify datatype of a variable at the time of decleration
	int i=10;
>in DT,language is responsible to decide datatype of a variable.
	i=10;
