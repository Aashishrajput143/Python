1.Character Set
2.Keywords
3.Literals

Character Set:
--------------
>set of characters supported by language
>ASCII and UNICODE character sets are commonly used in languages
>ASCII supports 128 chars
>Unicode(version 13) supports 143859 chars.
>python supports unicode from version 2.7


Keywords:
---------
>keyword are reserve words having special meanings
>we can not modify their meaning
>there are 36 keyword in python 3.9 and out of these 35,33 are in lowercase and 3 are in Capitalizecase.
	>True
	>False
	>None

Literal:
-------
>A value of specific type is known as literal
	>string literal
	>integral literal
	>floating literal
	>boolean literal
	etc.

>in python,integral literal can be represented as
	>decimal base 10 (0 to 9) default in python
	>octal	base 8(0-7)
	>hexa base 16(0-9,a-f)
	>binary	base 2(0,1)
Comment:
--------
>it improves readability of source file.
>single line comment(#)

Variables:
----------
>In python,a variable is a pointer or reference to a memory block

>it means,a variable does not store actual value and it stores address of value.

>	syntax in python:
		var=value
Note:
python is a dynamically typed language and data type of variable is decided by language itself based on assigned value

>in python,all values are immutable(unmodifiable) bcoz they are shared to multiple references.


Operators:	
----------
	>operators are symbols and sometimes keywords that perform
	mathmatical,relational,logical and other operations.
	
	Types:
	a. 	Unary Operators->required one operand
	b.	Binary Operators->required two operands
	c.	Ternary Operator->special syntax	
	Unary Operators:
		>Sign Operator
			a=-1,here - is sign operator
		>Inverse Operator:
			not True->False
			not False->True
	Binary Operators:
		>Assignment Operator
			.Simple Assignment
			.Multiple Assignment
			.Chained Assignment
			.Compound Assignment
		>Arithmetic Operator
			.+ (addition)
			.- (subtraction)
			.* (multiplication)
			./ (true div)
			.//(floor div)
			.% (modulo or remainder div)
			.**(power)
		>Comparision Operator
			.> (greaterthan),return True if left>right
			.<
			.>=
			.<=
			.==
			.!=
		>Logical Operator
			.and
			.or
			.not
		>Bitwise Operator
			.&	(bitwise and)
			.|	(bitwise or)
			.^	(bitwise xor)
			.>>	(bitwise rightshift)
			.<<	(bitwise leftshift)
	>Ternary(Conditional) Operator

		true_value if(condition) else false_value
			
>Conditions
-----------
		>if condition
		>if else condition
		>if elif condition
		>if elif else condition
		>nested condition
		
>Looping
---------
		>while loop
		>for loop
		
>Datatypes
----------
	>python is a dynamically typed language it means we need not to
	use datatypes explicitly and language autometically takes care
	of it.
	
	int:
		>it represents integral values
		>there is no limit of range
		>size is dynamically decided at runtime.
		Note:it is the only integral type in python
	float:
		>it represents decimal point(real) values
		>there is no limit of range
		>size is dynamically decided at runtime.
		Note:it is the only decimal point type in python
